# React Labs

## Lab 1: Component props

Build a component that will work as the column header for our table of students.

What props are we using?
What styling will we use?
What HTML will we generate?

## Lab 2: Event handling

Update your GridHeader component so that when you click on it (anywhere), it prints a message to the console: 'You clicked on the [field name] column".

## Lab 3: State

### Part 1

Eventually, clicking on GridHeader will toggle sorting of the data. For now, we just want to track which direction we are sorting. (We don't have any data yet, so we're not sorting anything!)

Set up state to track whether we are sorting ascending or descending. That is, every time a user clicks on a GridHeader, the state should change from ascending to descending or vice versa as appropriate. Validate that the state is correct by updating the console output to "You are sorting [field name] [direction]".

### Part 2

Use something as a sort indicator, and have it change when the sort direction changes. Remember that there are three states:

- When the component loads, there's no sort direction
- First click: ascending
- Second click: descending

...and then clicks toggle from that point.

Suggested sort indicators: You could use "V" for descending and "^" for ascending. Or you could go with emojis: üîº / üîΩ, ‚è´ / ‚è¨, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è / ‚¨áÔ∏è. Or you could find some images!
